# Tiff's Random Color Box
A random color generation site. The site generates many random colors and allows users to generate colors similar to specific presets. 

With the colors generated by the site users can:
* Single click to highlight the color's hex code
* Double click to find colors similar to that color

The site keeps a history of generated colors that the user has clicked on in the right sidebar. Users can click on colors in their history in order to generate more colors similar to that color. 

TODO: 
* Allow users to revert to the previous color palettes
